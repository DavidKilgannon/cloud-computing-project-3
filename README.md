Project Option 3
	To Do
		Install and deploy a multi-node computing service on CloudLab's OpenStack Cloud.
			Select a computing service consisting of at least two service nodes (i.e., a web server
			with a backend SQL server OR a Big Data Analytics Hadoop cluster with namenode and datanodes)
			and deploy the corresponding VMs inside CloudLab's OpenStack infrastructure
			
		Subtasks
			Able to setup VM nodes (possibly on local computers) that work together to provide a unified
			computing service to users.
			
			Able to move these VM nodes into the Cloud, setup proper network environment, and link them together.
	
	Deliverables
		1
			Team Description (This)
			Documentation describing the selected computing service, including network diagram and specific
			details on what services being installed on which VM.
			
			We will be making an Apache web server, a Postfix mail server, and MySQL. 
			
		2
			In-class demonstration of the selected computing services on local machines or on CloudLab
			(may or may not be automated on CloudLab)
			
			If readily possible it will be automated by this point.
		3
			Project report and/or GitHub repository contains the fully automated profile.
